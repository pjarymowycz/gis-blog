**Spatial Analysis and Visualization Initiative - Pratt Institute**

In my early 30s I decided to change career paths from teaching high school physics
to Environmental Engineering, which was more in line with my previous academic
pursuits. After completing a degree at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/),
I moved to New York City, but soon realized I had missed something in my studies: GIS.

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is a field that encompasses various topics,
ranging from creating simple digital maps to performing detailed spatial analyses.
Placing data on a map lets you visualize and understand it more easily, and with
more powerful GIS software, you are able to analyze and compare multiple datasets
in various ways.

I recently switched jobs to a position that allowed me a bit more flexibility with
my time, so I decided to complete a GIS certification.

The [Pratt Institute](https://www.pratt.edu/) in Brooklyn's Clinton Hill neighborhood
is primarily an art and design school, yet it offers one of the premier GIS
certification programs in NYC through its [Spatial Analysis and Visualization Initiative
(SAVI)](https://commons.pratt.edu/savi/). The focus of this program is not only to
provide instruction for technical mastery of the various GIS software products, but to
ensure students understand how to create maps that look good and tell the story
the mapmaker set out to tell.

With this new blog, I hope to use much of what I learned at SAVI, and what I will
learn in my future endeavors to help people appreciate maps and the stories they tell.
