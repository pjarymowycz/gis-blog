<p class="message">
  Hey there!
  <p>
    Welcome to my blog! I use this site for posting stuff that interests be, particularly about GIS and photography.
    This site was created with the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com).

## About Lanyon

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)
